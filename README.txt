Parking Project Prototype

The purpose of this project is to manage parking sports with a company's parking site. Employees can make reservations on spots throughout the day to make sure they have a spot when coming to a parking site. 

Reservations, accounts, and parking spots are all stored in a local SQL database. The app is written in C# and uses Xamarin Forms for the front end. 

Take a look at the demo to get a better understanding of the app.
